# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, where you compete against an AI. The game is written in Python and runs in the terminal.

## **How to Play**

1. Run the script using Python (Python 3.6 or higher recommended).
2. Enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` (case-insensitive).
3. The AI will make its choice randomly.
4. The winner of each round is determined based on the rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beat Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. The game continues until either you or the AI wins 3 rounds.

## **Features**

- Input validation to ensure correct choices.
- Dynamic score tracking displayed after each round.
- Clear announcement of the winner at the end of the game.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.6 or higher

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nimay-1/rock-paper-scissors.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors
